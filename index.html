			<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
            <div class="textbox">
			<p class= "story">The Three Little Pigs were living out in Pig Town. They’d been taught from their fathers to never make their homes out of hay, sticks or even bricks if they wanted to survive the wolf. As a result, they learnt creativity in house planning, but this did not stop the persistent wolf.

			All Three Little Pigs had different ideas of where was safest to live. Little Water Pig felt it was safest to move Pig Town over the lake. Wolves hate water, he thought. Little Tree Pig felt it was safest to be above the ground, in treetops, where the wolf can’t roam. Little Mole Pig felt it was safest to move Pig Town below ground, where wolves and hurricanes won’t devour you. The pigs had never experienced a hurricane before, nor were in they in a hurricane zone, but it was Little Mole Pig’s greatest fear that he would face one. The Three Little Pigs expanded the territories of Pig Town because each felt strongly about their idea of the safest dwelling spot.

			It was Little Water Pig’s first day in his house over the water. It was a simple, wooden house and it was motorised for easy access to land. He loved his new house, although, he found it rather small and quite limiting. He couldn’t clean the windows from the outside because there was no land to stand on. He also couldn’t hold a garden party for his upcoming birthday. But he could feel safe from the wolf. He lay on his bed that touched both ends of his house, bouncing the ball against the wall. The ball soon flew out the window and was lost to the water. He then started flicking his bedside lamp shade next to him until he flicked it so hard it fell over and the porcelain stand smashed. He then sat upright; his feet were tapping on the wooden floor. Tapping. Tapping. Maybe this house was a little too small for a hyperactive pig like himself. </p>

			<p class= "story">Little Water Pig was still tapping his feet against the sides of his house, he was enjoying the rhythm…tap.. tap… boink.. tap…tap…

			And then he heard the dreaded cry, calling from the side of the bank…

			 “Little Pig, little Pig, come to the land so I can come in”, said the wolf.

			Little Water Pig replied, “No! Never! Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin”.

			“Well then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house down”.

			So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew and he blew. The house didn’t fall over. It didn’t blow back either. In fact, the water between them didn’t even ripple. Little Water Pig punched his fist into the air, “Yes! I knew I’d be safe! Now I must tell the other two pigs.”</p>

			<p class= "story">Water Pig heard that there was a drought been spreading throughout the land. That would mean that in a matter of time the water would evaporate and that the wolf could reach his boat. He looked outside and saw that the wolf was waiting for the lake to dry up. Little Water Pig sneaked out of his boat house and splashed into the water, with his short and chubby arms and legs he peddled himself to the other side of the lake. The sun shone fiercely whilst Water pig caught his breath to continue to get to the save house of Tree Pig, who couldn’t have picked a tree further away from the lake.</p>

            <div class="textbox">
			<p class= "story">Tree Pig was standing below his tree house built between tall pine trees and one fir tree.

			Looking up at his house, he sees a leaf dropping in the motion of a swinging pendulum, until it lands gracefully on the ground. He snatched it, crunches it up like scrap paper and threw it in his recycling bin. Another one fell. He crunches it up and threw it away. Another one started falling, but he caught it before it landed and, once again, threw it away.

			 He felt triumphant for gaining dominion over the leaves. Then it occurred to him, this is the perfectionism that Little Water Pig complained to him about. So he kicked the bin over and scattered the leaves. Resisting the urge to pick the leaves up again, he climbed into his tree house where he also housed his best friends, the bees</p>

			<p class= "story">From the top, Little Tree Pig had a view of all dangerous situations, and just as well…

			He saw the wolf chasing something. Little Water Pig? He threw down his rope ladder and waited for Little Water Pig, who came hightailing around the corner, thighs flapping. Little Water Pig grabbed hold of the ladder, scurried up, and then Little Tree Pig helped reel it in before the wolf reached it. They were safe!

			Now the wolf was angry. He shook the tree from the base, “Don’t think you’re getting away from me”. The pigs held on to the branches tightly as the tree shook. The beehive above them detached itself from the branch and dropped, bouncing off different branches all the way down. The wolf opened his haversack and caught the hive with all the angry bees and closed them inside.

			Little Tree Pig yelled, “Those are our bees!”

			But the wolf didn’t care. He gave an evil grin then called out to The Two Little Pigs, “Little Pigs, Little Pigs, let me climb up or I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your tree house down.”

			The pigs said, “No! Never! Not by the hair of our chinny-chin-chin.”

			The pigs were smart, but the wolf was smarter. He used a magnifying lens, the sunlight and the dry sticks to create a thin wisp of smoke then he huffed and he puffed. With one final blow, he blew a force of life into the smoke, which ignited the beginning of a raging and uncontrollable wildfire. The pigs screamed and scattered out the tree and away from the woods. They ran on the tip of their hooves through thick fumes and away from the wolf to Little Mole Pig.</p>

			<p class= "story">From underground, Little Mole Pig heard screaming pigs overlaid with the crackling and whipping of flames. He curiously opened his trap door, which lead out to the dangerous world, peered over the top of his snout and saw the two little pigs trying to beat the fire and the wolf to Little Mole Pig’s door. Little Mole Pig saw a tall burning tree falling in slow motion. He yelled out to them, “Watch out!” The tree landed with a thump. It didn’t completely miss the pigs. It curled the hairs on their tails, but nothing more. The fallen tree also managed to separate them from the wolf.

			“Yes!” they shouted in unison.

                The Two Little Pigs went underground to Little Mole Pig, out of breath and out of danger. Little Mole Pig was smiling. His house had survived the drought and the fire.</p>

            <div class="textbox">
			<p class= "story">Wise Pig and Cranky Pig 1 and 2 were taken aback. They planned to save the pigs from the bad wolf, but instead they were faced with a fire. They can’t save the pigs from something much bigger and stronger than themselves. Red Shell Senior calmly said, “We came here to save the pigs, so lets save them.”

			The troop carefully navigated their way through the parts of the woods that weren’t ablaze. Behind the layer of fog, they saw two chubby figures charging on the tip of their hooves.

			“There they are!” said Little Wise Pig.

			“The smoke is making it very difficult to see far”, said Old Lad.

			Bamboo Queen thought to herself that their age had more to do with their impaired vision than the haze, but she didn’t find it the right time to point it out.

			They followed after The Two Little Pigs as fast as their scooters would allow… a moderate walking pace. They then pulled their breaks sharply when they saw the wolf standing over the trap door.

			Facing the wolf, Wise Pig was not feeling as courageous as he’d started out to be. He wondered: We’re a group of retirees and we’re trying to catch a wolf. What was I thinking?

			The others were staring at him, waiting for his signal, but he was in his thinking bubble.

			I know what I was thinking. The pigs are in danger and we’re going to do what it takes to save them! He looked at the others. Nodded. They nodded back, and in first gear, wheel spun their scooters to come face-to-face with their problem.

			Surrounding the wolf, Cranky Pig 1 said, “Ha! You’re not going anywhere, Wolf”.</p>

In climbed seven old strangers and an elephant’s head. Little Mole Pig held out his insect repellent spray in one hand and a lighter in another, “I’m not afraid to use this flammable spray if you don’t step out immediately”.

			The seniors explained who they were and their reason for being there. After a lot of convincing, Little Mole Pig sat back down and offered them a slice of their Black Forest cake.

			Black Forest, how appropriate, thought Bamboo Queen. Little Mole Pig, intrigued by the seniors’ benevolence, said with a mouthful of cake, “Why are our lives so important that you risked your own to save us”.

			“We know how it feels to live not knowing if you’ll see the next full moon. In our time, no one knew to help us. But today, the world knows its problems” said Wise Pig.

			Again, Enormous Ears tried to squeeze more than his fat neck through the door, but he couldn’t. Little Mole Pig said, “I did not build my home with elephants in mind”, and they all laughed.</p>
